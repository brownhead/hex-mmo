## Downloading and Building

Make sure your version of `node` and `npm` are up to date. `node` was probably installed with your OS's package manager (`apt-get`, `brew`, `yum`, ...), but `npm` can be told to upgrade itself by running `npm install -g npm`.

Make sure that you have `bower` installed and up to date by running `npm install -g bower`.

Make sure that you have `gulp` installed and up to date by running `npm install --global gulp` and then (inside of the `client/` directory) `npm install gulp`.
